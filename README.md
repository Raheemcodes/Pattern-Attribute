### What is the `pattern attribute`?

The `pattern` attribute is an attribute of the text, tel, email, url, password, and search input types

> The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression which the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the `pattern` text.
